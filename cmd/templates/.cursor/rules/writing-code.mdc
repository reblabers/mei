description: Tasks before writing code
globs: *.kt, *.sh, *.py, *.go

Before writing code:
1. Analyze all code files thoroughly
2. Get full context
3. Create `{featurename}.md` file into @.cursor/tmp
3. Write an implementation plan to a md file
4. Then implement code

Analysis and Planning:
* "please start analyzing full flow thoroughly, always state a confidence score 1 to 10"
* "List all assumptions and uncertainties you need to clear up before completing this task."

Best practices:
* "Check project files before suggesting structural or dependency changes"
* "Ask 'stupid' questions like: are you sure this is the best way to implement this?"
* Use words like "elegant" and "simple" in prompts
* "THE HUMAN WILL GET ANGRY."
